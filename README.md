## `rapgenius` has been replaced with `genius`

This gem is now deprecated in favour of the new [`genius` gem](https://github.com/timrogers/genius) which works with Genius's [new public API](https://docs.genius.com/).

For more details and help getting started, head to <https://github.com/timrogers/genius>.

If you're *really* sure you want to look at the README and not migrate to the new and much-improved gem, you can access the previous version [here](https://github.com/timrogers/rapgenius/blob/5fcb03cf307078c4aaafc3d564dbda990eb0d155/README.md).
